 * <para>The TCP Tunnel API.</para>
 *
 * <para>The TCP Tunnel API is a high level wrapper for streaming, allowing applications to tunnel traffic
 *  through Nabto by integrating through a simple TCP socket, just like e.g. SSH tunnels. TCP Tunnels
 * can hence be used to quickly add remote access capabilities to existing applications that already
 * support TCP communication.</para>
 *
 * <para>The client opens a TCP listener which listens for incoming TCP connections on the local
 * port. When a connection is accepted by the TCP listener, a new stream is created to the
 * device. When the stream is created on the device, the device opens a TCP connection to the
 * specified service. Once this connection is opened, TCP data flows from the TCP client on the
 * client side to the TCP server on the device side.</para>
 *
 * <para>TCP Tunnel instances are created using the Connection.createTcpTunnel() factory method.
 * The TcpTunnel object must be kept alive while in use.</para>
